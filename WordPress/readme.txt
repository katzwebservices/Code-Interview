Code is poetry. So is poetry.

== Description ==

This plugin does lots of motivational quotes things badly. If you add quotes, it'll (maybe) show them. The next update will be great, though!

== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin files to your plugins folder, or install using WordPress' built-in Add New Plugin installer
2. Activate the plugin
3. Add quotes in the Quotes menu

== Other Notes ==
Answering the question:
For Owl Carousel we can load funny quotes via wp_ajax which would load quotes using the current `funny_quotes_get_quotes` function. Since settings are saved as wp_options they can be retrieved anywhere in WordPress by a simple call to get_option.
